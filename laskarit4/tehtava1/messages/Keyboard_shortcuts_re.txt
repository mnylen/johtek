Hi,
 Sorry, the arrow key navigation can't be disabled. You can however disable/change most of the other shortcuts, see Preferences>Shortcuts.
 Funny thing is that arrow key navigation works how it does because a lot of users wanted it to behave this way... most of these are users who do not want to depend on the mouse for navigation.
 How would you want arrow key navigation to work?
 Best,
Silvio
