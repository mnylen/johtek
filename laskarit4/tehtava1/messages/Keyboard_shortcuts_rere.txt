Hi,

 I'd like it to behave like a web browser does:

 1. I can scroll through the page with up and down arrow keys.
 2. Whenever I'm at the bottom of the page, pressing the down arrow key won't do anything but give me a sound signal there's no more content to scroll by.

 And if I accidentally happen to press the right arrow key, I wouldn't like it to open the feed item in the in-app browser. Of course, my first instinct, when that happens, is to press cmd + left arrow key to go back, just like in the browser, but that won't work: I need to press left arrow key, which also moves the focus from the feed item content to the item list and now when I continue scrolling with my arrow keys, I move between items, not inside the content.

 If I want to go to next or previous item quickly using keyboard, I'd like to be able to assign special hotkeys for those.

 For now, it'd be enough if I could just get an option to completely disable all the arrow key related navigation shortcuts.
