Hello,

 recently (about three weeks ago) I purchased the Premium New User Bundle (http://www.ecigwizard.com/shop/start-bundles/15-premium-new-user-bundle.html). I'm having a bit of a problem with the 650 mAh batteries, though: the button starts blinking blue after being pressed down for five seconds. This happens with both 650 mAh batteries, but not with the 900 mAh battery. I'm using the cartomizer that was provided with the bundle.

 Might my battery be broken? It behaves like that even when fully charged, according to both chargers provided.

 Another question: are these batteries (http://www.ecigwizard.com/shop/batteries/58-ego-510-xl-battery-900mah.html) compatible with the atomizers and cartomizers that come with the above mentioned bundle?

 Best regards,
Mikko Nyl√©n
