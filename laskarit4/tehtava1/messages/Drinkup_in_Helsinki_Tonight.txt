Drinkup in Helsinki Tonight

Hi,

My name is Scott Chacon, I'm a developer at GitHub. I'm in Helsinki this week for Reaktor Dev Day and noticed your profile
location was nearby. We're hosting a drinkup tonight at Bar Cuba at 7pm and would like to invite you to come out to the event.

It should be a good turnout and a chance to meet other local developers. Feel free to invite your friends, too.
Hope you can stop by; we're buying the beer! (don't forget to order the special GitHub beer)
